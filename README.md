# vim-piglit

Vim syntax highlighting for [piglit](https://piglit.freedesktop.org/) related
files.

## What's suppported

If more things get added to piglit, this list will expand.

* shader\_test files*

*Things like `[fragment program]` aren't supported quite yet, when I start
working with these things I will add support.

## Installation with Vundle

This plugin depends on [vim-glsl](https://github.com/tikhomirov/vim-glsl), so
first make sure you have that installed.

Afterwards, add the following to your .vimrc:

```
Bundle 'lyude/vim-piglit'
```
